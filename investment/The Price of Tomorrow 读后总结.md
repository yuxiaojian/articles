# "The Price of Tomorrow" 读后总结

作者Jeff Booth在《明日之价》（The Price of Tomorrow）一书中介绍了经济体中的两大力量——科技进步带来的通缩和央行印钱引起的通胀，这两种力量互相对立。科技进步带来的通缩是一种发展中自然形成力量，商品和服务应该变得越来越便宜，然而实际却是越来越贵，这是因为人为不断印钱的缘故。

科技发展遵循指数规律，一旦越过了前面的平缓增长阶段，后面的增长将是非常惊人的。Booth举了一个例子，一张纸，如果对着50次后，纸的厚度将相当于地球到太阳的距离。人类科技发展正在一个指数增长的转折点上，这将成倍的降低各种商品和服务的成本，我们购买商品理应更加便宜，我们应该生活在一个不断通缩的时代。然而，政府和央行却在竭力阻止通缩的发生，人为的造成通胀，即各种商品越来越贵，这是为什么呢？

首先，适当的通缩会刺激经济增长，增加就业。其次，会增加政府权力，赢得选票。由于过去的经验，我们的思维也形成了一种定势——认为东西就是应该变得越来越贵。房子、教育、医疗的价格变化等等都在不断强化我们的这种认知。主权货币与黄金脱钩后，货币就是已经成为各大央行中的一个数字，政府维护货币信用的责任不断被增发货币带来的快感所侵蚀，增发的货币规模也越来越大。

2000年，全球的债务总额为62万亿美元，经济规模33.5万亿。到2018年，经济总量只是增长到80万亿，而债务总额却达到247万亿。也就是说，这18年间，全球用185万亿的债务换来了46万的经济增长。债务对于经济增长的边际效益越来越低。

> In 2000, the total debt in the world was approximately US$62 trillion. At the same time, the world economy in 2000 was about US$33.5 trillion. Since 2000, the world economy has grown from US$33.5 trillion to about US$80 trillion, but to achieve that growth, the total debt has grown to over US$247 trillion as of the third quarter of 2018, according to the Institute of International Finance. In other words, it has taken approximately $185 trillion of global debt to achieve $46 trillion of global growth.

印钱造成了各种资产的价格不断走高，为了维护这种高资产价格带来的繁荣，央行不得不加速印钱维持这种繁荣。2008年金融危机本来是一次资源错配和高风险投资的自然矫正，如果放任危机发展，我们会看到房地产价格的大幅下跌，大量金融机构的倒闭，平时谨慎储蓄的人们会迎来一起低价捡黄金的机会。然而，我们看到的是政府和央行的量化宽松，投机者们得到了褒奖。2020年疫情以来，各大央行又放开印钞机大量注水，这种措施带来选票，政府不得不印更多的钱以取悦选民，这是一个正反馈。现在，已经没有那个政府胆敢紧缩政策或者放任债务违约，这是不可承受之短期之痛。留给政府的只有两条路——不断印更多钱和加税。

世界上没有免费的午餐，央行大量的印钱其实导致了社会巨额财富不平等（坎蒂隆效应 Cantillon Effect），扭曲了自由竞争的定价规则，造成了严重的资源配置不当。对拥有资产的人来说这是一场盛宴，对持有现金的人们这是一场赤裸裸的掠夺。美国前5%的有钱人掌握了社会2/3的财务，而仅仅Jeff Bezoes, Bill Gatew和Warren Buffets三人的财富就占超过50%。 

> in the United States, the top 5 percent of the population now holds more than two-thirds of the wealth, while the remaining 95 percent of the population fights for their share of the other third. Just three people—Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett—account for more wealth than 50 percent of the population.

这种贫富差距会造成人们的怨恨情绪和人群分裂。英国脱欧, 川普主义，全球内强权主义抬头并非孤立事件。货币战，贸易战，任由其发展，那接下来就是热战，痛苦之后人们从头再来。

在当前的债务规模下，并没有很好的解决方案，任由其发展未来又将承受巨大代价。Booth认为应该让科技发展的力量来接管，经济由通胀转为通缩发展，并且通过比特币这种绝对稀缺的商品，并将所有的经济计算建立在其基础上，才能将技术通缩映射到经济中，从而给出真正的定价信号。值得我们注意的是，不管央行继续印钱和比特币取代美元成为国际结算货币，未来资产价格的大幅通缩都不可避免，我们应该为此做好准备。

Booth对于本书的关键论述主要集中在前面和后面几章，中间大量的穿插了他对与科技发展的理解和预见。书中有不少精彩的句子，摘录如下：

* As my friend Thuan Pham, the chief technology officer of Uber, recently said to me over breakfast, “I am a firm believer that talent is distributed evenly around the world, but opportunities are not.”
* The only thing driving growth in the world today is easy credit, which is being created at a pace that is hard to comprehend.
* f it takes ever-increasing credit growth to achieve economic growth, how are our economies any different from a Ponzi scheme?
* Deflation, put simply, is when you get more for your money—just as inflation is when you get less for your money.
* Designing a platform to take advantage of strong network effects creates lock-in and winner-take-all markets
* When someone stays in a bad relationship, investment, or job, they are often unknowingly a victim of the sunk-cost bias, keeping in the status quo for fear of change, even though the status quo is something that they do not want
* All of these wonderful technologies make many things easier and cheaper. They increase efficiency and decrease costs, which mean they are deflationary. They also remove the need for people to do many things---in other words, they get rid of jobs
* Dalio concludes that in the end, “Policy makers always print. That is because austerity causes more pain than benefit, big restructurings wipe out too much wealth too fast, and transfers of wealth from haves to have nots don’t happen in sufficient size without revolution.”
* As the theorist Nassim Nicholas Taleb writes in Antifragile, “we notice what varies and changes more than what plays a larger role but doesn’t change. We rely more on water than on cell phones, but because water does not change and cell phones do, we are prone to thinking that cell phones play a larger role than they do.”
* Deflation is being caused by technology and, because of that, it will ride the same exponential wave that technology does. That means that the rate of deflation (without printing more money) will only accelerate from here.
* By nature, though, quantitative easing also causes currency devaluation, even if that’s not what it’s specifically intended to do. The government doesn’t actually have more assets; it’s just representing its assets with more units of currency, which means each unit of currency is worth less—like cutting a pizza into twelve slices instead of eight, or dividing an estate between ten heirs rather than nine.
* Another way of error correcting for these natural biases and stories, according to my friend Bob Sutton, is to argue as if you were right, but listen as if you were wrong
* We should ask whether those same assets would have gone up over the last twenty years if there hadn’t been $185 trillion of new capital injected into economies over that time. When that stops, which it eventually will, things will change very quickly.
* As the old saying of British historian Lord Action goes, "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."
