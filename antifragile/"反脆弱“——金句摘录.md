# "反脆弱"——金句摘录



风会熄灭蜡烛，却能使火越烧越旺。对与随机性、不确定性和混乱也是一样：你要学会利用它们，而不是躲避它们。你要成为火，渴望风的吹拂。 

>  Wind extinguishes a candel and energizes fire. Likewise with randomness, uncertainty, chaos:  you want to use them, not hide from them. You want to the fire and wish for the wind



反脆弱超越了复原力和强韧性。复原力能让事抵抗冲击，保持原状；反脆弱则让事物变得更好。

> Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.
>



反脆弱喜欢随机和不确定性，这也意味着——这一点非常关键——它也喜欢错误，准确的说是某一类错误。反脆弱有一个奇特的属性，他能帮助我们应对未知的事情，在不理解的情况下做事，并且做的还不错。让我更直白些：由于反脆弱性，我们做的要比我们认为的要好。我宁愿做愚钝但具有反脆弱的人，也不愿做极其聪明但脆弱的人

> The antifragile loves randomness and uncertainty, which also means—crucially—a love of errors, a certain class of errors. Antifragility has a singular property of allowing us to deal with the unknown, to do things without understanding them—and do them well. Let me be more aggressive: we are largely better at doing than we are at thinking, thanks to antifragility. I’d rather be dumb and antifragile than extremely smart and fragile, any time.
>



我们可以通过一个不对称性的测试来检测反脆弱和脆弱性。任何在随机事件（或者一定的打击）获得有利结果大于不利结果的事物都是反脆弱的（反之则是脆弱的）

> And we can almost always detect antifragility (and fragility) using a simple test of asymmetry: anything that has more upside than downside from random events (or certain shocks) is antifragile; the reverse is fragile.
>



这是现代化的悲剧，正如神经质般过度保护子女的父母，那些试图帮助我们的人往往会给我们造成最大的伤害。如果说一切自上而下的事物会让我们变得脆弱，一切自下而上的事物在适量的压力和混乱下反而能蓬勃发展。发现（或创新，或技术进步）的过程本身就依赖于反脆弱的自由探索和积极的冒险而非正规的教育。

> This is the tragedy of modernity: as with neurotically overprotective parents, those trying to help are often hurting us the most. If about everything top-down fragilizes and blocks antifragility and growth, everything bottom-up thrives under the right amount of stress and disorder. The process of discovery (or innovation, or technological progress) itself depends on antifragile tinkering, aggressive risk bearing rather than formal education.



社会最大的脆弱性制造者和最大的危机制造者，正是那些置身事外，不承担后果的人

> Which brings us to the largest fragilizer of society, and greatest generator of crises, absence of “skin in the game.”



黑天鹅事件是指造成大规模的不可预知的和不定期的具有严重后果的事件。某些观察者没有预知这些事件的发生，这些人通常被称为“火鸡”，他们会被黑天鹅事件惊吓并且伤害。

> Black Swans (capitalized) are large-scale unpredictable and irregular events of massive consequence—unpredicted by a certain observer, and such unpredictor is generally called the “turkey” when he is both surprised and harmed by these events.



黑天鹅事件会绑架我们的大脑，让我们以为差不多甚至几乎预测到了它们，因为当我们回顾时黑天鹅事件都是可解释的。我们没有意识到黑天鹅事件对生活的影响是因为我们存在可预测的幻觉。现实生活远比我们记忆中的生活更为错综复杂——我们头脑倾向于将历史以更平滑和线性的方式呈现出来。 

> Black Swans hijack our brains, making us feel we “sort of” or “almost” predicted them, because they are retrospectively explainable. We don’t realize the role of these Swans in life because of this illusion of predictability. Life is more, a lot more, labyrinthine than shown in our memory—our minds are in the business of turning history into something smooth and linear, which makes us underestimate randomness.



我们不用混淆合理和合理化——这两者几乎是完全相反的

> And let us not confuse rationalizing with rational—the two are almost always exact opposites.



脆弱厌恶波动（反之亦然），最为奇怪的是这种明显的的特征被在科学和哲学的范畴之外。

> The strangest thing is that this obvious property that anything fragile hates volatility, and vice versa, has been sitting completely outside the scientific and philosophical discourse.



为了与践行者的气质相符，我践行并且做到这本书中所说的原则

> To accord with the practitioner’s ethos, the rule in this book is as follows: I eat my own cooking.



具有反脆弱的事物只是在一定程度的压力下。你的身体受益于一定的误操作，但仅仅在一定程度下——从通天塔上被扔下来可没有什么好处。

> And things are antifragile up to a certain level of stress. Your body benefits from some amount of mishandling, but up to a point—it would not benefit too much from being thrown down from the top of the Tower of Babel.



我们知道的比我们以为的要多，比我们能表达更要多很多。

> We know more than we think we do, a lot more than we can articulate.
>



再次强调，有限的，低剂量的有毒物质有利于健康。

> Again, limited, low-dose poisoning triggers healthy benefits. 



这种成功，经济增长和创新是压力之下过度补偿的观点还未被主流说接受。

> It is not part of the accepted way of thinking about success, economic growth, or innovation that these may result only from overcompensation against stressors.



受挫后过度反应中释放出来的多余能量驱动了创新。

> The excess energy released from overreaction to setbacks is what innovates!
>



当时他们没有注意到下面的不一致性：一旦发生所谓的最坏事件，那它就会超过以前的最坏事件。

> But they never notice the following inconsistency: this so-called worst-case event, when it happened, exceeded the worst case at the time.
>



人类和和过去斗争，而大自然则与未来斗争。

> If humans fight the last war, nature fights the next one.



比如，很多人因为辩解反而伤害了他们的名声。

> For instance, many wreck their reputations merely by trying to defend it.



越想掩盖秘密，传播反而越广。

> The more you insist that it remains a secret, the more it will spread



对于一本书的批评反映了真实的、好不虚假的关注，表明那本书并不无聊，要知道无聊是一本书最致命的缺陷

> Criticism, for a book, is a truthful, unfaked badge of attention, signaling that it is not boring; and boring is the only very bad thing for a book.
>



如果你希望人们读一本书，就告诉他们这本书被“高估了“，同时带上一些气愤的语调（要获得相反的效果，则采用“被低估”的态度）

> So if you really want people to read a book, tell them it is “overrated,” with a sense of outrage (and use the attribute “underrated” for the opposite effect).



我从未听到外界对你的指责。你已证明自己根本无法激发别人对你的嫉妒。

> "I never hear anything wrong said about you. You have proven yourself incapable of generating enemy"



我们常看到一个令人费解的现象，即给我们带来最大利益的并不是那些曾试图帮助我们（比如提供“建议”）的人，二是那些曾努力伤害我们但最终未能如愿的人。

> It is quite perplexing that those from whom we have benefited the most aren’t those who have tried to help us (say with “advice”) but rather those who have actively tried—but eventually failed—to harm us.
>



在复杂的世界里，原因本身就是让人怀疑的：要么不可能确定原因，要么无法界定原因。报纸总是试图给我们提供各种原因，这也是为什么要去忽视报纸。

> In the complex world, the notion of “cause” itself is suspect; it is either nearly impossible to detect or not really defined—another reason to ignore newspapers, with their constant supply of causes for things.



你的身体从环境中得到信息不是通过你的逻辑机制、智慧或者推演能力，而是源自于压力，并通过荷尔蒙和我们一些尚未发现的机制。 

> Your body gets information about the environment not through your logical apparatus, your intelligence and ability to reason, compute, and calculate, but through stress, via hormones or other messengers we haven’t discovered yet.



人类在急性刺激下比在慢性刺激下表现的更出色，尤其是在急性刺激后给予较长的恢复期，这样压力源就会传导信息。

> Humans tend to do better with acute than with chronic stressors, particularly when the former are followed by ample time for recovery, which allows the stressors to do their jobs as messengers.



如果你不是洗衣机或者布谷鸟钟的话，或者换句话说你还活着，你的灵魂深处就渴望一定程度的随机和混乱。

> If you are not a washing machine or a cuckoo clock—in other words, if you are alive—something deep in your soul likes a certain measure of randomness and disorder.
>



创业企业的脆弱性带来的整个经济体的反脆弱。个人的创业者的脆弱和他们必要的高失败率早就了生生不息的创业精神。

> The fragility of every startup is necessary for the economy to be antifragile, and that’s what makes, among other things, entrepreneurship work: the fragility of individual entrepreneurs and their necessarily high failure rate.



一个系统内的某些部分可能必须是脆弱的，这样才能使整个系统具有反脆弱性。或者有机体本身是脆弱的，但它遗传给新生命的基因信息缺失反脆弱的。

> So some parts on the inside of a system may be required to be fragile in order to make the system antifragile as a result. Or the organism itself might be fragile, but the information encoded in the genes reproducing it will be antifragile.



事后的适应，不管多快，总是有点迟。

> Post-event adaptation, no matter how fast, would always be a bit late.



更进一步的，我认为失败者的特征就是，失败者在失败后不反省，不探究，因为失败觉得难堪，为失败辩解，试图为失败找理由而不是从失败中学习并且翻篇前进。这些人往往把自己视为某个大阴谋、糟糕老板或恶劣天气的受害者。

> Further, my characterization of a loser is someone who, after making a mistake, doesn’t introspect, doesn’t exploit it, feels embarrassed and defensive rather than enriched with a new piece of information, and tries to explain why he made the mistake rather than moving on. These types often consider themselves the “victims” of some large plot, a bad boss, or bad weather.



犯了很多错误（同样的错误没有一次以上）要比那些从来没有犯过错误的人更靠谱。

> And someone who has made plenty of errors—though never the same error more than once—is more reliable than someone who has never made any.
>



那些没有发现什么的人其实也给别人提供了知识，而且是最好的知识，因为他们告诉别人这样做不行，但他们却很少获得承认

> Someone who did not find something is providing others with knowledge, the best knowledge, that of absence (what does not work)—yet he gets little or no credit for it.



这是生活中的一种核心错觉，即随机性是有风险的，是一件坏事，并且认为消除随机性就可以消除风险

> This is the central illusion in life: that randomness is risky, that it is a bad thing—and that eliminating riskness is done by eliminating randomness
>



换句话说（这一点也值得多次强调）避免小错误会使大错误更加严重

> In other words, a point worth repeating every time it applies, this avoidance of small mistakes makes the large ones more severe.
>



现今的时代，每7秒就有一人死于糖尿病，但新闻对此视而不见，却整天报道那些龙卷风受害者和直升飞机营救的抓眼球事件。

> At the present time, one person is dying of diabetes every seven seconds, but the news can only talk about victims of hurricanes with houses flying in the air.



平均斯坦波动，极端斯坦跳动。平均斯坦有很多小变动，极端斯坦很少变动却会很剧烈。

> One (Mediocritan) fluctuates, the other  (Extremistan)  jumps. Onehas a lot of small variations, the other varies in lumps.



从火鸡的故事中我们看过一个所有伤害性错误的根源——误把证据不足当成证据不存在。这种错误在知识界和社会科学界根深蒂固的存在。

> We can also see from the turkey story the mother of all harmful mistakes: mistaking absence of evidence (of harm) for evidence of absence, a mistake that we will see tends to prevail in intellectual circles and one that is grounded in the social sciences.
>



人人常常看到短期的收益而无视长期效应，并且据此来决策

> It is also interesting that people tend to grasp the opposite more easily, that is, spot the error of analyzing immediate gains without taking into account the long-term side effects.



森林中的小火会烧掉易燃物质而避让大火，经济中的波动会让经营不善的企业倒闭而避免整个经济体的问题。

> Just as a little bit of fire here and there gets rid of the flammable material in a forest, a little bit of harm here and there in an economy weeds out the vulnerable firms early enough to allow them to “fail early” (so they can start again) and minimize the long-term damage to the system.



“我为你做了什么”比“我让你避免了什么”受欢迎的多

> It’s much easier to sell “Look what I did for you” than “Look what I avoided for you.”



是否能承受时间的考验是脆弱性的最好测试，因为把时间拉长，总是会发生很多混乱。目前时间测试且在强韧性上合格的只有大自然。

> Time is the best test of fragility—it encompasses high doses of disorder—and nature is the only system that has been stamped “robust” by time.



因为新闻的频率很高，过多的信息也是有害的，就像过多摄入糖分一样。每日新闻带来的噪声和糖所导致的机体功能紊乱其实机理是一样的。

> Here again, as with news received at too high a frequency, too much information becomes harmful—daily news and sugar confuse our system in the same manner. 



媒体只会报道抓眼球的事件（飓风、事故、飞机失事这样的坏新闻更抓眼球），让我们对风险的认知产生的扭曲。

> But the media only report the most anecdotal and sensational cases (hurricanes, freak accidents, small plane crashes), giving us a more and more distorted map of real risks.



政治和经济的“尾部事件”无法预测，他们的概率无法被科学的衡量

> Political and economic “tail events” are unpredictable, and their probabilities are not scientifically measurable.
>



强韧性和反脆弱性让生活更为简单，因为具有了这两种特性就没必要像脆弱性那般需要精确的预测未来，其实具有之后就根本没必要去预测未来。

> What makes life simple is that the robust and antifragile don’t have to have as accurate a comprehension of the world as the fragile—and they do not need forecasting.



胖子托尼不相信预测。但他预知那些预测者会完蛋，并且赚的盘满钵满。

> Fat Tony did not believe in predictions. But he made big bucks predicting that some people—the predictors—would go bust.



你通常不会去预测，但你预知这些依赖预测做决策的人们会去承担更多风险，未来他们会有麻烦甚至可能破产。为什么？预测者总是比不预测的要脆弱。

> You can’t predict in general, but you can predict that those who rely on predictions are taking more risks, will have some trouble, perhaps even go bust. Why? Someone who predicts will be fragile to prediction errors.



成功会带来不对称性，这是因为成功后更会患失还不是患得，这就变得脆弱了

> Success brings an asymmetry: you now have a lot more to lose than to gain. You are hence fragile.



我心目中的现代斯多葛践行者能够把恐惧转化为谨慎，将痛苦转化为信息，将错误转化为启示，将欲望转化为事业。

> My idea of the modern Stoic sage is someone who transforms fear into prudence, pain into information, mistakes into initiation, and desire into undertaking.



迈向反脆弱的第一步是减小不利因素，而不是增加有利因素。也就是说通过降低自己暴露与负面“黑天鹅”事件的概率，让反脆弱性自然的发挥作用。

> The first step toward antifragility consists in first decreasing downside, rather than increasing upside; that is, by lowering exposure to negative Black Swans and letting natural antifragility work by itself.



我最初使用杠铃模型来描述这种双重态度从而实现反脆弱性，就是在某些领域极度保守（从而在负面“黑天鹅”面前保持强韧性），而在其他领域承担很多小的风险（开放的面对正面的黑天鹅）。

> I initially used the image of the barbell to describe a dual attitude of playing it safe in some areas (robust to negative Black Swans) and taking a lot of small risks in others (open to positive Black Swans), hence achieving antifragility.



反脆弱是积极主动加上保守偏执——向下一定要保底，保护自己免受极端伤害，同时向上开放，让正向的黑天鹅自己发挥作用。

> For antifragility is the combination aggressiveness plus paranoia—clip your downside, protect yourself from extreme harm, and let the upside, the positive Black Swans, take care of itself.



让孩子玩点火，但不要过头，好让他们从伤痛中吸取教训，这是为了他们自己未来的安全考虑。

> It means letting children play a little bit, not much more than a little bit, with fire and learn from injuries, for the sake of their own future safety.



我们有足够的证据表明，人们厌恶小的损失，但对非常严重的“黑天鹅”风险却没有引起足够的注意（他们往往会低估），因为他们往往会为避免小的可能损失，而忽略了大的罕见的损失。

> We have ample evidence that people are averse to small losses, but not so much toward very large Black Swan risks (which they underestimate), since they tend to insure for small probable losses, but not large infrequent ones.



我的原则是：不吸烟，不吃糖（尤其是果糖），不骑摩托，不在城市以外的地方骑自行车，或者更广泛的说不在没有交通的区域，比如撒哈拉沙漠，不与东欧的黑社会有瓜葛，不上没有专业飞行员的飞机。除此之外，我可以承担各种形式的职业和个人风险，尤其是那些不会给我带来任何致命伤害的风险。

> The rules are: no smoking, no sugar (particularly fructose), no motorcycles, no bicycles in town or more generally outside a traffic-free area such as the Sahara desert, no mixing with the Eastern European mafias, and no getting on a plane not flown by a professional pilot (unless there is a co-pilot). Outside of these I can take all manner of professional and personal risks, particularly those in which there is no risk of terminal injury.
>



更进一步的，你永远不会再面对选择之前认知你自己和你的真正偏好。记得我们说过波动给我们提供了关于我们和别人的信息。很多人们变得贫穷并非他们最初的愿望，他们只有编造出一个故事，声称他们自己选择变成穷人的，这才让他们变得强韧，就好像他们有选择权一样。

> Further, you will never get to know yourself—your real preferences—unless you face options and choices. Recall that the volatility of life helps provide information to us about others, but also about ourselves. Plenty of people are poor against their initial wish and only become robust by spinning a story that it was their choice to be poor—as if they had the option.



这值得再次强调，选择权，任何选择权，只要有利因素超过不利因素，就会让你变得更为反脆弱

> And, it is worth repeating, options, any options, by allowing you more upside than downside, are vectors of antifragility.*



那些大脑中充斥着复杂技巧的人们往往会错过基本的事物。

> People with too much smoke and complicated tricks and methods in their brains start missing elementary, very elementary things.
>



当你脆弱时需要比不脆弱知道多的多。反之，如果你认为你知道的比你做的多，那你就是脆弱的。

> When you are fragile you need to know a lot more than when you are antifragile. Conversely, when you think you know more than you do, you are fragile (to error).



显而易见的是历史有失败者来写，因为失败者（相比成功者）手里有很多时间和一个学界的地位。

> So it is easy to see that history is truly written by losers with time on their hands and a protected academic position.
>



我们不是把理论用于实践，而是从实践中创造理论。

> No, we don’t put theories into practice. We create theories out of practice.



去重复（因为知识分子总是忘掉这一点）证据不足并非证据不存在，这暗示的以下一点：对于反脆弱，好消息倾向于在过去的数据中缺失，而对于脆弱性，坏消息在过去的数据不那么容易显现出来。

> To repeat (it is necessary to repeat because intellectuals tends to forget it), evidence of absence is not absence of evidence, a simple point that has the following implications: for the antifragile, good news tends to be absent from past data, and for the fragile it is the bad news that doesn’t show easily.



当时胖子托尼的厉害之处来自于他从来不会让别人来构建问题的框架。他跟尼罗说过，问题的答案永远根植于问题之中的；千万不要回答 一个对你来说毫无意义的问题。

> But Fat Tony’s power in life is that he never lets the other person frame the question. He taught Nero that an answer is planted in every question; never respond with a straight answer to a question that makes no sense to you.



关键在于非对称性会极大的受到极端事件的影响——当是没有人对极端事件有兴趣因为他们在精神上就不喜欢极端事件

> The key is that the nonlinear is vastly more affected by extreme events—and nobody was interested in extreme events since they had a mental block against them.



对与知识最重要也是最有坚韧性的贡献其实是去掉那些我们认为错的东西——减法认知

> The greatest—and most robust—contribution to knowledge consists in removing what we think is wrong—subtractive epistemology.
>



知识会因为否认增加而不是肯定，因为我们今天认为对的以后很可能是错的，而今天认为错的却很少以后会变成对的

> So knowledge grows by subtraction much more than by addition—given that what we know today might turn out to be wrong but what we know to be wrong cannot turn out to be right, at least not easily.



一个很明显且有趣的悖论是长期预测比短期预测更为可靠，因为黑天鹅事件在历史的长河中总会被湮灭

> An interesting apparent paradox is that, according to these principles, longer-term predictions are more reliable than short-term ones, given that one can be quite certain that what is Black Swan–prone will be eventually swallowed by history since time augments the probability of such an event.
>



存活下来的机会都有一些明显的优点，这让我们以为所有有优点的机会都会存活

> because all surviving technologies have some obvious benefits, we are led to believe that all technologies offering obvious benefits will survive.



所以遵从林迪效应选书：那些风行了10年的书将还会风行10年甚至更多

> So I follow the Lindy effect as a guide in selecting what to read: books that have been around for ten years will be around for ten more;
>



没有切身利益在其中的预测就像是没有工程师睡在现场的核电站一样危险

> Predicting—any prediction—without skin in the game can be as dangerous for others as unmanned nuclear plants without the engineer sleeping on the premises.



从来不要问别人的意见，预测或者推荐。就需要问他们的账户中有什么。

> Never ask anyone for their opinion, forecast, or recommendation. Just ask them what they have—or don’t have—in their portfolio.



使研究人员喝自己所酿的酒可以就解决很多科学中的问题

> I believe that forcing researchers to eat their own cooking whenever possible solves a serious problem in science.
>
