# You're About to Make a Terrible Mistake 中的案例

## Great Oil Sniffer Hoax

石油嗅探器大骗局是1979年涉及法国石油公司Elf Aquitaine的一桩丑闻。该公司花费数百万美元开发了一个新的基于重力波的石油探测系统，后来发现这是一个骗局。埃尔夫公司在这场骗局中损失了超过1.5亿美元。在法国，这一丑闻被称为 "Avions Renifleurs"（"嗅探飞机"）。Alf Aquitainer 是一家法国国有石油公司。

> In 1975, in the wake of the first oil shock, the French government launched an advertising campaign to encourage energy savings. Its tagline: “In France, we don’t have oil, but we do have ideas.” That same year, two men approached Elf Aquitaine, the French state-owned oil major. The two had no prior experience in the oil industry but claimed to be inventors of a revolutionary method for discovering oil underground without drilling. Their method, they explained, would allow a specially equipped airplane to “sniff” oil from a high altitude.
>
> The so-called technology was, of course, a fraud—and not even a particularly sophisticated one. The con artists had fabricated, ahead of time, the images that the miraculous machine would produce during test runs. When the trials took place, they simply used a remote control to make images of oil reserves appear on the screen.
>
> The story may seem preposterous, but the leaders of Elf Aquitaine—from the scientists in the R&D department to the CEO—bought it. When the time came to commit large sums of money to test the new process, they convinced the prime minister and the president of France to sign off. Remarkably, the scam went on for more than four years and cost the company roughly one billion francs. From 1977 to 1979, the amounts paid to the con men even surpassed the dividends that Elf Aquitaine paid the French state, its controlling shareholder.

2004年，美国加州一家家Terralliance的公司有一次上演了类似的骗局。受骗的投资者有高盛，Kleiner Perkins等大投资者

> Or would they? Fast-forward thirty years to 2004. The place: California. A start-up called Terralliance is raising money. Its founder, Erlend Olson, has no experience in the oil industry: he is a former NASA engineer. What is his pitch? You guessed it! He wants to perfect a technology for detecting oil from airplanes.
>
> The same scam takes place again, only the set and the actors have changed. This time the investors are Goldman Sachs, the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, and other big-name investment firms. The “inventor” has the rugged charm of a Texas cowboy. The rustic Boeing 707 that Elf Aquitaine purchased has made way for Sukhoi jets, bought surplus from the Russian army. History repeats itself so neatly that approximately the same amount of money, adjusted for inflation, is invested: half a billion dollars. Needless to say, the results are just as disappointing as they were the first time around: “sniffing” oil from airplanes, apparently, is quite difficult.

这两起事件背后投资者一定做过大量的调查，可还是陷入了一个事后看来显而易见的陷阱，很大程度上是因为投资相信了骗子讲出的这个故事。

## J.C Penney 零售店

Ron Johnson曾在苹果创建了苹果商店而名声大噪，后来被聘入J.C Penney，曾想按苹果商店的方式改造零售店，但其改造计划惨遭失败。苹果商店的成功更多是因为iPhone手机的成功和在苹果商店的专卖，苹果商店的设计和营销只是次要原因。

> Champion bias and experience bias were both at work in the story of J. C. Penney. In 2011, this middle-market retailer, which operated some 1,100 department stores, was searching for a new CEO to breathe life into the aging company. Its board of directors found itself a “champion,” a savior with the perfect résumé: Ron Johnson. A true retailer, Johnson had successfully transformed merchandising at Target. But most of all, he was credited (along with Steve Jobs, of course) with creating and developing the Apple Stores, which revolutionized electronics retailing and became one of the most stunning successes in the history of retail. What better leader could J. C. Penney find to spearhead its reinvention? No one doubted that Johnson would produce results just as spectacular as those he had achieved at Apple.
>
> Johnson suggested a strategy that was a radical break from tradition, and he implemented it with rare vigor. In essence, he took inspiration from the strategy that had made the Apple Stores successful: an innovative store design, offering a new in-store experience in order to attract a new consumer target. But he applied it even more energetically to J. C. Penney, because he was now transforming an existing company instead of creating one from scratch.
>
> Johnson’s zeal for change knew no bounds, and his Apple inspiration was evident. Conscious that brand power played a key role in the Apple Stores’ success, Johnson struck costly exclusive agreements with major brands and began reorganizing stores around brands, not departments. Remembering that Apple had spent extravagantly to create a luxurious setting for its products, Johnson invested large sums in redesigning J. C. Penney stores and rebranding them “jcp.” Mirroring Apple’s inflexible policy of fixed prices, with no sales or discounts, Johnson broke with Penney’s practice of nonstop promotions and ubiquitous rebate coupons, replacing them with everyday low prices and modest monthly sales. Fearing that J. C. Penney’s staff would not implement these changes energetically enough, Johnson replaced a large portion of its management team, often with former Apple executives.
>
> Surprisingly, none of these changes were tested on a small scale or with focus groups before they were implemented across the company. Why? Because, as Johnson explained, Apple disdained tests, and that never stopped it from being wildly successful. Did anyone harbor doubts about this radical break in strategy? “I don’t like negativity,” Johnson would reply. “Skepticism takes the oxygen out of innovation.”
>
> To say that the results of this strategy were disastrous would be an understatement. Regular J. C. Penney customers no longer recognized the store or found coupons to draw them there. Other customers, whom Johnson wanted to wow with the new “jcp,” were not impressed. By the end of 2012, sales were down 25 percent, and Penney’s annual losses were approaching $1 billion, despite 20,000 layoffs to reduce costs. The stock price was down 55 percent.
>
> Johnson’s first full year at the helm would also be his last. Seventeen months after his arrival, the board of directors finally ended the experiment. It rehired Johnson’s predecessor, who tried as best he could to undo everything Johnson had done.

## 计划偏差

按时完成计划依赖于所有假设都完美的完成，但只有有一个条件出现偏差就会导致计划偏差，生活中有处处充满了意外。

> A second kind of optimism, called the *planning fallacy* , specifically concerns estimates of the time and budget we will require to complete a project. Anyone who has had their kitchen renovated knows the problem; but on a bigger scale, it can reach epic proportions. The construction of the Sydney Opera House, begun in 1958, was supposed to cost 7 million Australian dollars. It cost 102 million and took sixteen years. And this is not a unique case—far from it. The impressive Getty Center in Los Angeles opened its doors in 1998, ten years later than originally planned, after eating up $1.3 billion, nearly four times more than its initial budget. The next-generation nuclear power plant in Flamanville, France, should have been completed in 2012 at a cost of 3.5 billion euros; as of 2019, it was scheduled to open in 2023 and to cost 12.4 billion euros. Similar or worse delays and overruns are expected on two other sites piloting the same technology in Olkiluoto, Finland, and Hinkley Point, in the UK. A global study of 258 transportation infrastructure projects—railroads, tunnels, bridges—showed that 86 percent of them went over their original budget. And, of course, aerospace and defense projects are notorious for their astronomical overruns: the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program is on track to exceed initial cost estimates by tens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars.
>
> We overlook the fact that success requires the alignment of many favorable circumstances, while a single glitch can derail everything. Above all, we focus on our plan as seen “from the inside”; that is, we don’t consider the universe of similar projects that took place in the past, ask ourselves what schedules and budgets they anticipated and whether they experienced delays and overruns.

# Netflix

2000年时，Netflix创始人Reed Hastings曾经打算出售公司，以5000万美元卖给BlockBuster，出于某种原因BlockBuster退缩了，现在BlockBuster已经破产，Netflix却如日中天。最开始时，创始人打算给公司取名叫Kibble，最终选择了Netflix。

> In the early 2000s, the U.S. market for video rentals was a large, profitable industry. It accommodated all kinds of players, from mom-and-pop corner stores to regional chains. But it had its eight-hundred-pound gorilla: Blockbuster. With its 9,100 stores, the chain, led by John Antioco, generated revenue of about $3 billion.
>
> Meanwhile a fledgling start-up, founded in 1997, had begun competing on an entirely different business model. For a flat monthly subscription fee, its customers could go online to create a “queue” of DVDs on the company’s website and have them shipped for free to their mailbox. Once they mailed back the DVDs they had watched, they would automatically receive the next DVDs in their queue. It wasn’t a high-tech model, but it met consumer needs: with a centralized video library, movies were less frequently out of stock, and advice on selecting a title was more relevant. Above all, while the video stores imposed stiff penalties on customers who returned their videos late, the monthly fee model, like an all-inclusive phone plan, acted as a no-surprises guarantee. By early 2000, the start-up had signed three hundred thousand subscribers. Its name: Netflix.
>
> By the time the dot-com bubble burst that spring, Netflix was not yet profitable, and the company was in dire need of financing. Its CEO, Reed Hastings, and his close associates paid Blockbuster a visit and made John Antioco a straightforward offer: Blockbuster would acquire 49 percent of Netflix, and turn it into its internet arm, under the brand [Blockbuster.com](http://Blockbuster.com) . Blockbuster stores would also sell Netflix’s subscription service. It would be a seamless “click-and-mortar” company, along the lines of what many retailers are still trying to accomplish today. The price tag Hastings put on his company was $50 million.
>
> How did John Antioco and his team respond? “They just about laughed us out of their office,” Netflix’s leaders later related. For Antioco, Netflix was not at all a threat. Of course, the start-up had developed a small customer base on the web. But this was the era of dial-up internet, long before broadband became standard. The concept of streaming movies was still unimaginable for most people. Furthermore, Antioco probably reasoned that if Blockbuster ever wanted to imitate Netflix with a monthly subscription model, nothing would stop him from doing it all on his own.
>
> We all know how this story ends. Netflix reached 1 million subscribers in 2002 (the year it went public) and 5.6 million by 2006—still with its low-tech, rent-by-mail model. Only later would the rise of streaming give it a decisive boost. By early 2020, Netflix had 167 million subscribers. Its market capitalization was over $150 billion, several hundred times its introduction price (and three *thousand* times the price Antioco could have paid).
>
> As for Blockbuster, it did try to launch its own subscription service in 2004. It was too little, too late. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2010. David had conquered Goliath.



## 宝丽来

1996年， 拍立得相机的发明者及制造商宝丽来（Polaroid）是摄影器材的领导者，以精湛的技术、行销技巧与市场的主导地位备受推崇。在前一年，它的营收是二十三亿美元。股市对新到任的执行长盖瑞．迪卡米洛（Gary DiCamillo）以及他的新策略计画也展现信心。自他走马上任，股价上涨将近50%。四年后，宝丽来声请破产。1996年，宝丽来的数位事业营收超过一亿美元，而且成长迅速。旗舰款数位相机PDC-2000公认是该类型商品中最顶级的产品。迪卡米洛完全明白这场科技革命的重要性。他的策略计画所涵盖的三大主题当中，数位策略排在首位。宝丽来的沉船不是因为船长没有看到冰山。它的沉没是因为船要转向太难。

>  If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change. D’you understand?
>
> In 1997, Polaroid was a world leader in photography, admired for its technological mastery, marketing skills, and dominant market share. It had booked revenues of $2.3 billion in the previous year. The stock market had confidence in its recently arrived CEO, Gary DiCamillo, and his new strategic plan. The stock price had increased by almost 50 percent since his arrival. Four years later, Polaroid filed for bankruptcy.
>
> The story looks like yet another example of “death by digital disruption.” But there are important differences between Polaroid’s story and Blockbuster’s. Neither DiCamillo nor his predecessors underestimated the importance of digital photography. As early as 1990, I. MacAllister Booth, the company’s long-serving CEO, who had spent almost his entire career at Polaroid, told shareholders that “we intend to be a major player in the powerful emerging trends in electronic imaging.” In 1996, Polaroid’s digital business exceeded $100 million in revenue and was growing fast. Its flagship digital camera, the PDC-2000, was considered the best product in the category. DiCamillo was fully aware of the importance of this technological revolution. Of the three major themes his strategic plan covered, digital was the first. Polaroid’s shipwreck didn’t happen because the captain didn’t see the iceberg. It happened because the ship was just too hard to turn.
>
> The problem is widespread: organizations don’t always do what their leaders decide. When they face disruption in their market, companies change much, much slower than the words at the top. The focus of their people’s energies and the allocation of their financial resources does not mirror the boss’s stated strategy. This inertia has its roots in a combination of cognitive biases and organizational factors. And sometimes, as for Polaroid, it is deadly.



## 锚定效应

起始问题影响甘地的寿命估计

> Surprisingly, anchors influence us even when they bear no relationship to the estimated value, and even when they’re patently absurd. Following the seminal experiments of Kahneman and Tversky in the 1970s, two German researchers named Thomas Mussweiler and Fritz Strack demonstrated this effect with remarkable creativity. In one of their experiments, they divided their subjects into two groups, asking one group whether Mahatma Gandhi was over or under 140 years old when he died, and the other whether he was over or under 9 years old when he died. Obviously, no one had trouble answering these questions. But when the respondents were then asked to estimate Gandhi’s age at death, these clearly ridiculous “anchors” made a difference: the group anchored on 140 thought, on average, that Gandhi had died at age 67, whereas the group anchored on 9 believed he had died at age 50. (Actually, Gandhi died at age 78.)

预算调整总是基于去年的预算

> The effects of anchoring are amplified by human and organizational dynamics that any experienced manager will recognize. Building a strategic plan or developing a budget entails constant negotiation between players in the organization. In any negotiation, anchoring matters: whatever number serves as the starting point is the anchor. In a budget discussion, these starting points are known and highly visible. The head of the business unit that had a marketing budget of 100 last year will perhaps request 110 this year, but rarely 200. With the same anchor in mind, you may ask her to make do with 90, but you won’t suggest 40. Anchoring implicitly establishes negotiating boundaries.

掷色子会影响法官的判决

> One of them involves judges, whose decisions are not supposed to be made lightly. The experimenters submitted a detailed file about a shoplifting case to a panel of experienced judges and asked them what sentence they would give the thief. But the file lacked an important piece of information: the sentence sought by the prosecution. The judges were asked to produce this number themselves by throwing two dice and writing down the result, which would represent the number of months on probation sought by the prosecution. Producing the number this way could leave no doubt in their minds that it was randomly generated. The judges were also told that the reason this number was determined at random was to ensure it did *not* influence their sentencing decisions. Nevertheless, it did: the judges who rolled a three issued a sentence of five months on average, whereas those who rolled a nine sentenced the defendant to eight months! 

## 土星汽车

通用200亿美元投资的土星最后惨遭关闭

> In business, the most striking examples of escalation of commitment are found in companies that try desperately to save failing initiatives. A spectacular case is Saturn, the division created by General Motors in 1983 to compete against Japanese imports. The original idea was to create a “different kind of company” making “a different kind of car.” Saturn’s products and methods would not be subject to the rules of the giant company (and its sluggish bureaucracy). Not everything went according to plan—to say the least: by 2004, over *twenty years* after its launch, Saturn had swallowed up more than $15 billion and, according to industry analysts, had never made one cent of profit. So what did management decide to do? They recommitted $3 billion to transforming Saturn into an “ordinary” division of GM! The division was no more successful than the semi-independent company had been. Only in 2008, as part of GM’s government bailout, was Saturn put up for sale. By then, of course, there were no buyers. It was finally shut down in 2010.
>
> The case of Saturn is extreme: few companies can afford to lose some $20 billion over twenty-seven years of consistent failure. But GM’s reluctance to get rid of a failing business and its limitless faith in successive turnaround plans are far from unusual. In fact, large companies divest businesses much less often than one would expect. A study of two thousand companies over seventeen years showed that they executed, on average, only one divestment every five years. The total value of divestments was one-twentieth of the amount they spent on acquisitions.

## 当前偏差

人们更重视当前

> In a classic behavioral economics experiment, you are asked if you’d rather receive $100 today or $102 tomorrow. It’s likely that you will choose $100 today. Common sense is on your side, as two proverbs with equivalents in many languages suggest. First of all, “time is money”: $100 received today can earn interest until tomorrow. Second, “a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush”: waiting for anything is risky, because a promise may not always be kept.
>
> The choice between $100 today and $102 tomorrow is a question straight out of Economics 101. To compare a present value to a future value, we use a *discount rate* : an interest rate that reflects both time and risk. By choosing $100 today instead of $102 tomorrow, you have implicitly indicated that your discount rate is higher than 2 percent per day. In other words, for you to be willing to wait, your patience and risk-taking would have to be compensated at a higher rate. For example, if the $102 option were replaced by a promise of $150, you would quite probably choose to wait.
>
> So far, so good. The problem is that we are not at all consistent in the discount rates that we apply. Let’s use the same figures but change the dates. Would you rather receive $100 *in a year* , or $102 *in a year and a day* ? For the vast majority of us, this is a no-brainer. If we’re going to wait such a long time, what’s one extra day? We might as well get $2 more!
>
> This seems natural, even obvious. But it’s actually illogical. If in the first situation you chose $100, but in the second you decided to wait to get $102, why does your discount rate change over time? To ask the question more simply, if you’re willing to wait one more day to get $2 more, why don’t you do it right now? Or, to make the paradox even more obvious: in exactly one year’s time, won’t the choice of the second situation be exactly the same as the first—a choice between today and tomorrow?
>
> As this experiment shows, we are much less patient when one of the options involves the immediate present. We’re much more likely to choose a bird in the hand when the decision is made today, and more likely to choose two in the bush when it takes place tomorrow. This tendency, called *present bias* , has been extensively demonstrated. For instance, in an experiment similar to the one described above, Richard Thaler asked subjects to choose between a payment of $15 right now and a larger payment in the future. How large would that payment need to be to justify the wait? The median answer was $100 if the payment was to be delayed by ten years and $20 if it was delayed by one month. The numbers may not seem absurd, but from an economist’s perspective, they are: the implicit annual discount rate they reflect is 19 percent with a ten-year horizon, but 345 percent with a one-month horizon.

## 人绝非完全理性的

经济学以理性人为前提构建起一座大厦，可这个前提非常不靠谱

> A striking counterexample is provided by studies of the “ultimatum game.” In this experimental setting, two participants (randomly assigned to one of two roles) must share a sum of money. The first one suggests a way to divide the money. The second can either accept and receive the amount of money allocated by the first or refuse. In the event of a refusal, neither participant gets anything.
>
> An Econ proposer seeking to maximize personal gain should suggest taking the lion’s share for himself. And an Econ respondent should accept any split offered, no matter how small his share: whatever he gets is better than the alternative, which is nothing. Yet this is not what happens. Generally, participants propose sharing the money in a relatively equitable way. When, on the contrary, they behave like selfish Econs and propose a very unequal division to their own advantage, most of their partners refuse. By doing this, they do not hesitate to deprive themselves of financial gain in order to “punish” the proposer who overplayed his hand. These results have been replicated many times over, notably in low-income countries, where the sums of money involved could represent three months’ income for the participants.

## 孙正义的投资决定

以直觉做投资决定——成也萧何败萧何

> After all, there are plenty of counterexamples. There are tyrannical leaders who don’t give a fig about what their collaborators think. There are dyed-in-the-wool intuitive thinkers who break out in hives at the very word *process* . And quite often they succeed! The image we have of Steve Jobs—rightly or wrongly—is that of a charismatic leader who cared little about collaboration and not at all about process, and whose success was nevertheless unquestionable. Or consider how Masayoshi Son, the founder of SoftBank, describes his decision to invest $20 million in Alibaba in 1999: “He [Jack Ma, Alibaba’s founder] had no business plan...but his eyes were very strong. Strong eyes, strong shining eyes. I could tell.” This, to say the least, is not anyone’s idea of a collaborative decision, much less one that follows a process. Yet it turned out to be perhaps the most successful investment decision anyone ever made: twenty years later, SoftBank’s share in Alibaba was worth roughly $130 *billion* .

> The flip side, of course, is that the same individuals have made mistakes, too. Steve Jobs’s spectacular failures are part and parcel of his legend. And Masayoshi Son apparently relied on the same gut-feeling approach to make much more questionable decisions than the Alibaba one. These include a much-derided $300 million bet on Wag, the “Uber for dog-walking.” More consequentially, Son made a $10 billion investment in the parent company of WeWork, whose cofounder, Adam Neumann, certainly had strong shining eyes, too (Son compared him to Jack Ma). Neumann, however, had to resign when his eccentric behavior and controversial accounting practices led the company to cancel its initial public offering; and SoftBank had to invest an additional $8 billion to bail out WeWork and stave off immediate bankruptcy.
